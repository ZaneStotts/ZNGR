## Description

This website is intended to be an environment to share and display my skills for potential employers or even just for people interested in learning more about me personally. My hopes are to update it regularly with videos, songs, and other coding creations.

## Languages

My project is constructed from primarily HTML and a lot of CSS styling, as those two languages are the ones I'm most comfortable with right now. I also added some JavaScript to make the picture viewing functions.

## Design

I aimed for a minimal aesthetic scheme while maintaining a responsive layout. Didn't want to include too many clashing hues or unnecessary flourishes. Keep things very simple and as clean as possible. I really liked the combination of plain white and fire brick red and thus included them as the main recurring color theme, along with a light pink accent.

## Reflections

This programming venture has helped me learn in more depth the ways in which HTML functions, such as the box model and what tags to use in order to better structure a website. Also discovered more when it comes to CSS, such as flex box tricks and grid arrangements. I feel more confident about using JavaScript now. I'm very certain this new knowledge will be beneficial to me in the future.
